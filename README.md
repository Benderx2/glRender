# glRender

glRender is a WIP 3D rendering library that is mostly intended to be a learning experience.

Thanks to the BennyQBD for some of his sample OpenGL code that has helped me understand the different intricacies of OpenGL.

Maybe this will someday become an actual game engine.

(P.S. All code is licensed as PROPRIETARY- Just kidding, it's public domain, why would I license this shit?)
