# glRender

glRender is a WIP 3D rendering library that is mostly intended to be a learning experience.

Thanks to the BennyQBD for some of his sample OpenGL code that has helped me understand the different intricacies of OpenGL.

Maybe this will someday become an actual game engine.

# Current Features

* Object-Oriented style
* Supports Wavefront-OBJ/MD2 file formats (with MD2 animations)
* Inbuilt text rendering
* A very concrete SDL2 backend implementation
* Code seeks to be portable
* And various others, please see examples/example01.cpp for a detailed view of the engine's functions

(P.S. All code is licensed as PROPRIETARY- Just kidding, it's public domain, why would I license this shit?)
